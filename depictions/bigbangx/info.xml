	<shortDescription> Search, translate and combine selected text in the clipboard from different applications
</shortDescription>
	<descriptionlist>
		<description> Sometimes you need to combine selected parts of text (or separate words) from different applications into a single whole.
Or you need to see the translation of only part of the copied text.
And sometimes, select individual words from the entire copied text and see their definitions or use them to navigate in the browser.
BigBangX will help you with this.
Huge functionality: working with the clipboard, text recognition, URL schemes, Activator support and calling functions through the control center.

Doesn't support iOS12.
Doesn't support iPad.
