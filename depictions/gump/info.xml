		<description> Tired of the moments when you listen to music and decided to put some kind of tweak and respring stops playing music?

This tweak will correct such an injustice. It will allow you to enjoy your music as you respring.

WARNING: this tweak may not work well with devices that are jailbroken with unc0ver.

ATTENTION: the "Restart Services" and "ldrestart" buttons may work incorrectly. It is better to do the last command through the terminal, or any other tweak that has this feature..
