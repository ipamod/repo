		<description> • Say no to the annoying call interface.
Scorpion replaces the standard calling interface with a sleek and unobtrusive design. It supports standard calling, FaceTime audio and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications such as WhatsApp, Messenger, Skype, and more.

• Interface settings.
The Scorpion is available with three visually appealing and contemporary styles to choose from, allowing the user to create challenges that best adapt to their needs.
Scorpion has a wide range of customizations available that allow users to create a unique calling interface. From color to animation; from call handling to gestures. The tweak was designed with user freedom in mind. You can customize the background color, popup, transitions, etc.

• Call control.
Scorpion provides the same controls as the standard call user interface and easily adapts them to different use cases such as multiple calls or VoIP calls..
